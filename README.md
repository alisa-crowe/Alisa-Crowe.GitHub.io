Selected dataset: [Data Science Jobs and Salaries Indeed](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritiksharma07/data-science-jobs-and-salaries-indeed)

- Applications: Somebody searching for a job could use NLP to determine if there are any keywords included in the job description field that typically correlates to a higher salary. They could then find out which skills are considered more valuable for data science jobs and improve on them by taking classes or completing relevant projects. Additionally, one could conduct an analysis of the job market by seeing how the different variables, such as company or location, affect the average salary. Predictive models could also be created and trained on the data in order to predict the salary of a data science related job, given variables such as location, job title, and description.


Selected book: [Gaussian Processes for Machina Learning](http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/) by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams, MIT Press, 2006. 

- I am interested in this book because it seems like it explores a lot of the foundational math behind many popular machine learning techniques, such as regression and classification. Since my degree is in mathematics, I think the contents of this book would complement the knowledge I already have while allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning, an aspect of data science I am excited to learn more about.
